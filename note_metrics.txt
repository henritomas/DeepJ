1. Qualified Note Rate
	- ratio of qualified notes (notes no shorter than three time steps) over
    the total number of notes 
    - implies fragmentation if low

2. Polyphonicity 
    - defined as the ratio of the number of time steps where more than 
    two pitches are played to the total number of time steps.

3. Note Count/Note Rate
    -notes used given same amount of time 

4. Mean Note Interval 
    -average time between notes

5. Pitch Range 
    -highest pitch used - lowest pitch used 

6. Average Pitch Interval
    -average pitch difference between notes in sequence
