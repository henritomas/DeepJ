1. Qualified Note Rate
	- ratio of qualified notes (notes no shorter than three time steps) over
    the total number of notes 
    - implies fragmentation if low

2. Polyphonicity 
    - defined as the ratio of the number of time steps where more than 
    two pitches are played to the total number of time steps.

3. Note Count/Note Rate
    -notes used given same amount of time 

4a. Mean Note Interval 
    -average time between notes

    Note interval Standard Deviation/Variance

5. Pitch Range 
    -highest pitch used - lowest pitch used 

    Pitch Histogram
    -how many times each possible pitch was used

    Average Pitch Interval
    -average pitch difference between notes in sequence

Lets do:

X Similarity of Correlation Coefficients
X Note Count, Note Rate
- Average time between notes
X Pitch Histogram
X Mean Note Interval (Polyphonicity)
